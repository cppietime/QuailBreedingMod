# Quail Breeding
Four types of quails can be found naturally spawning in the wild (tier 0):
- Brown Quail,
- Painted Quail,
- Elegant Quail, and
- Northern Bobwhite
Quails, like chickens, lay eggs (quail eggs!), and can be bred using any type of seed. While breeding two quails of the same type will always produce a child of the same, two quails of different types, when bred together, may have a chance to yield another type. There are 8 tiers of quail types. Each type has its own drop to replace their eggs, and some have extra properties like the ability to be milked, or extra loot dropped upon death. These pairings can be found below.

Both chicken and quail eggs can now be smelted or cooked to produce a fried egg - a food item. Also, both can be combined with a water bucket to produce another food: pickled eggs. Quail eggs can also be used to craft cakes in place of chicken eggs.  
Eight wooden planks surrounding one Iron Bar crafts one Quail Jail. These items can be used to catch a quail and hold it in the player's inventory, then release it when used again. Quail Jails are single-use.  
A Quail Jail, Quail Egg, 3 Redstone, and 4 Iron Ingots can be crafted into a Quail Meter. When used on a quail, this item will print its stats, such as breed, laying time, and laying amount. These values can vary from quail to quail, and can be bred for by choosing the right parents.  
A Quail Meter surrounded by eight Iron Ingots produces a Strong Quail Jail. This acts the same as a Quail Jail, but is reusable. Also, all the stats that the Quail Meter displays will appear on the Strong Quail Jail's tooltip when it is holding a quail.  
Seven cobblestone surrounding one Cactus, with an opening on top, produces a Voider. The Voider is a block that accepts input from Hoppers and Droppers like any other container, and, upon receiving an input item, destroys it. These can be used to destroy overflows of items in a farm.
